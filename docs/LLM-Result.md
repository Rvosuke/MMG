## LLM实验结果

测试微调后的LLM的效果，应该使用不同的输入进行测试，注意控制变量产生的影响。

| ID   | 矫正视力 | 性别   | 年龄 | 眼压    | 图像分析       | 诊断结果           | 严重程度 | 治疗建议            |
| ---- | -------- | ------ | ---- | ------- | -------------- | ------------------ | -------- | ------------------- |
| 001  | 0.8      | Male   | 52   | 22 mmHg | Normal         | No Glaucoma        | N/A      | Routine Check-up    |
| 002  | 0.5      | Female | 45   | 14 mmHg | Mild Changes   | Suspected Glaucoma | Mild     | Consult Specialist  |
| 003  | 0.3      | Male   | 60   | 8 mmHg  | Severe Changes | Confirmed Glaucoma | Severe   | Immediate Treatment |

LLM将从6个角度进行回复：图像分析（若有）、诊断结果、严重程度、治疗建议、医院推荐、医师推荐。



### Sample LLM Output for a Patient

**Patient Data**:

- **Visual Acuity**: 0.5
- **Gender**: Female
- **Age**: 45
- **Intraocular Pressure**: 24 mmHg
- **Fundus Image Analysis**: Indicates mild retinal nerve fiber layer thinning.

**LLM Diagnostic Response**:
"Based on the provided data and image analysis, there is a suspicion of mild glaucoma. It is advisable to consult an ophthalmology specialist for further diagnostic tests and possible treatment options."

### Geographic-Specific Recommendations
**Geographic Location**: Guanshaling Street, Yuelu District, Changsha City, Hunan Province

**Recommendations**:
- **Hospitals**: 
  - **Xiangya Hospital, Central South University**: Well-known for its ophthalmology department, located approximately 10 km from Yuelu District. Specialized in treating various stages of glaucoma.
  - **Hunan Provincial People's Hospital**: Offers advanced diagnostic tools and treatments for eye diseases including glaucoma.
- **Specialist Recommendation**:
  - **Dr. Li Hua**: Senior ophthalmologist at Xiangya Hospital, specialized in glaucoma surgery and treatment.

This format helps in making the LLM's output actionable and contextually relevant, especially by incorporating local healthcare resources which could significantly enhance the patient's decision-making process and subsequent medical care pathway.
