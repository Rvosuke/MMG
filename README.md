This repository provides the Python code for implementing the initial screening model proposed in the paper "A Machine Learning Framework for Grading Glaucoma Severity for the Tiered Healthcare System in China". The model utilizes traditional machine learning algorithms (SVM, XGBoost, LR, KNN) to perform glaucoma screening based on preliminary medical data.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 Glaucoma screening using basic medical data (age, gender, BCVA, IOP, CDR)
- 🛠️ Implementation of SVM, XGBoost, LR, and KNN models
- ⚙️ Hyperparameter optimization with Bayesian Optimization (BO)
- 🔬 Model interpretability analysis using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)

| Model   | Accuracy   | Sensitivity | Specificity | AUC        |
| ------- | ---------- | ----------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| KNN     | 0.6453     | 0.6303      | 0.6682      | 0.7155     |
| SVM     | 0.7697     | 0.8273      | 0.6820      | 0.8486     |
| LR      | 0.7697     | 0.8364      | 0.6682      | 0.8488     |
| XGBoost | **0.8208** | **0.8394**  | **0.7926**  | **0.8929** |
